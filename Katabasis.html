        <h1> About </h1>
        <p> Katabasis is an experimental, hyperlinked narrative experience. 
            It is a work that aims to stitch together the seperate 
            engines of Bitsy and Decker through a central webpage 
            built in HTML and CSS with scripts in JS. </p>

<!-- TODO: -->

<!-- make html file to house the game projects and scenes? -->
<!-- program an interface for the game menu -->


<!-- In the Bitsy File: -->
<!-- access DOM in JS to add "hello world" -->
<!-- or toggle the css in scripts -->
<!-- move data from into global varriable that can accessed from the other -->
<!-- stitch together scenes via buttons -->
<!-- think about the architecture and storyboard -->
<!-- look in manual on debugging -->
<!-- some game vars may already be accessible through the console -->
<!-- gain familiarity and legibility with the code -->



<!-- In the Decker File: -->
