        <h1> About </h1>
        <p> Katabasis is an experimental, hyperlinked narrative experience. 
            It is a work that aims to stitch together the seperate 
            engines of Bitsy and Decker through a central webpage 
            built in HTML and CSS with scripts in JS. </p>

        <!-- DOM elements loaded before script, can run event listeners too -->
        <script src = >
            // stripe script or use i-frame? 
        </script>

    </body>

<!-- TODO: -->

<!-- framework/frame set these narratives are in -->
<!-- what's modular, rather than abstract between platforms that can hold -->
<!-- pick-up specific use case, state in child file for parent file -->
<!-- make html file to house the game projects and scenes? -->
<!-- recieve item from decker game into bitsy game -->
<!-- figure out how to reapply changes to autogenerated code -->
<!-- what are those changes looking like, bitsy vs decker -->
<!-- another thing could be puzzles with decker code?  -->
<!-- adding something to a function that passes a state to a global var -->
<!-- cookie or local storage for keeping track of data -->
<!-- use dev tools to access vars -->
<!-- program an interface for the game menu -->
<!-- go into console to access vars -->
<!-- js script doing find & replace, looking for the patterns, accessing the js of the other code -->
<!-- js function (exec) let's interpret a string as code and run it -->



<!-- In the Bitsy File: -->

<!-- function to parse game data, read and write to new file -->
<!-- explore methods for bitsy code in docs -->
<!-- access DOM in JS to add "hello world" -->
<!-- or toggle the css in scripts -->
<!-- move data from into global varriable that can accessed from the other -->
<!-- stitch together scenes via buttons -->
<!-- think about the architecture and storyboard -->
<!-- look in manual on debugging -->
<!-- some game vars may already be accessible through the console -->
<!-- gain familiarity and legibility with the code -->
